# Whack-A-Mole VR - Unity Project
Whack-A-Mole VR is designed from ground up to be a flexible platform for studying and designing simple VR-based pointing tasks:
 * **Visual Skins**: In its basic state, it mainly provides simple green targets that players must hit. But it's designed to be easy to adapt to other visual metaphors while maintaining the same underlying interaction: catching butterflies, picking apples, and so on.
 * **Modifiers**: Whack-A-Mole VR provides a range of tools to modify or alter the experience, many of which are specifically designed to experimentally treat or diagnose neglect.
 * **Scriptable Patterns**: Whack-A-Mole VR's can load different treatment programs from files known as patterns, which specify how/when targets appear and how/when different modifiers activates.
 * **Data Collection**: Whack-A-Mole extensively logs player movements and interactions, while players are playing.

The game is a simple Whack-a-mole-style game, but in VR. The game is primarily run on VR headsets connected to a computer, from which a facilitator (clinician) controls and monitors the game, while the player is wearing the headset.  In front of the player a wall is presented which show multiple moles (represented by gray disks). When the game starts, moles will activate by changing their color to green. The player will then need to pop the moles by hovering over them with the blue cursor (highlighted by the red square) before they deactivate by themselves. Players hit targets by moving their arm around horisontally or vertically in the air (relative pointing, a bit like using a mouse). There are also distractors, which activates that the player musn't pop.

The environment provides many features to customise the game, with multiple parameters and modifiers available when you click on the modifiers button.

- Game modifiers: 
  - Game duration: allows to set the duration of the game
  - Game speed: allows to set the speed of the game between three options (slow, normal, fast). The higher the speed, the more moles will spawn and the higher the fake moles's spawn coefficient will be.
  - Mirror effect: mirrors the player's VR controller's position and rotation. All their movements will be reversed except the ones on the vertical axis.
  - Geometric Mirror: Creates mirror therapy by providing a ghost secondary controller which mirrors the movements of the player.
  - Eye patch: applies an eye patch. Disables one of the player's eye in the VR headset. Can be set to either left, right or none.
  - Hide Wall: Controls how much of the wall is visible to the player, forcing the player to increase how much head rotation is needed.
  - Speed: In random moles mode, this controls how fast new moles appear.
  - Controller Offset: Offsets the controller from the user's body horisontally. Can be used to force players to move their arm more towards the right or left.
  - Prism effect: applies a rotation of the player's camera, which mean their line of sight change relative to the position of their hand. Forces players to look more to the right or left.
  - Motorspace Size: Changes how much movement is needed to perform the pointing task.

While players play, the game continuously collects data in the background. When a session stops or has finished, the data can either be uploaded to a database or saved locally to disk as a .CSV file. The data can then be visualized on the [online dashboard](https://github.com/med-material/Whack_A_Mole_RShiny).

## Tools for Developers

The application has several tools available to debug and help developing new features.

### Debug controls 
Simple non-VR controls are implemented to use in the game for pattern and visual effects testing.
When starting the application, first you will need to get through the calibration phase. You can bypass this by pressing "V".

### VS Code Extension

**WAM Test Pattern**
This extension for Visual Studio Code offers improvements to reading and coding treatment programs, with Syntax Highlighting and Auto-Completion, available at this link: https://github.com/tcaruchet/Whack_A_Mole_VR_WAMPAT_VSCodeExtension

**EditorConfig for VS Code**
If you use using VSCode, install *EditorConfig for VS Code* (in VSC extension list) to comply with the style rules defined in the .editorconfig file. No configuration is necessary; the extension automatically complies with the file formatting.
If you are using VS, you do not need to install it, as the IDE already has it built in, in project mode.

### Patterns debug mode
The **Pattern Manager** script has a Debug Mode implemented which, if active, shows information about the state of the current treatment program, the next step, as well as the number of steps and progress through the program.

## Mole Whacking Data Collection

This application logs various game datas, from the activated mole position to the position travelled by the player's laser between two mole poping. The logs are by default saved in the OS documents directory (e.g. C:\Users\XYZ\Documents\), however a custom path can be set from the Unity editor. The logging happens in three diffferent files and the architecture is explained further [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iP6VDRuE3DzOMys-ztHc_QtDELSFZ1KeNmDyQoJZi10/edit#slide=id.g1029978cd0c_0_10).
